1. All structures are limited to a maximum height of 50 feet, unless such limitation would prevent or unreasonably interfere with the transportation purposes of the railroad.
2. When no longer in use by the railroad operator, bridges, trestles, culverts, tunnels, or other structures that may have considerable value for, and may potentially facilitate, the development of recreational trails, such structures should be preserved and maintained for this purpose.
