          The Buffalo Green Code Unified Development Ordinance Becomes Effective
          Citywide.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Unified Development Ordinance now effective citywide, April
          3, 2017 marks the culmination of a nearly seven-year effort that
          involved thousands of community members in neighborhoods throughout
          our city. Since Mayor Byron W. Brown initially announced the Buffalo
          Green Code, on Earth Day of 2010, the effort has been a
          community-driven process aimed at ensuring the Green Code reflects the
          values of our residents. Thank you to all of you who have dedicated so
          much of your time and passion during this historic initiative!
