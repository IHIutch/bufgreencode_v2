The Chair may designate an alternate member to substitute for a member when such member is unable to participate because of a conflict of interest on an application or matter before the Zoning Board of Appeals.

Such designation must be entered in the minutes of the initial Zoning Board of Appeals meeting at which the substitution is made.
