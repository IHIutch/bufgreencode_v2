A development that involves new construction with a residential component in the C-M zone must meet a minimum density of 36 dwelling units per acre where the underlying zone is N-1C, 24 dwelling units per acre where the underlying zone is N-2C or N-2E, and 18 dwelling units per acre where the underlying zone is N-3C or N-3E.
