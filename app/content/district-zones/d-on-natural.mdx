## 4.10.7 Specific Standards

1. Trails and related public amenities, such as boardwalks, pavilions, and observation towers, are encouraged provided they do not negatively impact sensitive habitats.
2. Substantial alteration to existing topography and landscape is permitted only as necessary to restore ecosystem services or a natural, pre- development condition.
3. Native vegetation, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees, may be disturbed only as necessary to control noxious or invasive vegetation or to remove dead, dying, or diseased vegetation. Where removal of native vegetation is unavoidable to facilitate civic uses or public access, native or naturalized vegetation must be replaced in kind elsewhere on the site.
4. Materials used for elements, features, and objects within the site should use muted, natural colors. Bright, reflective colors, including white, are discouraged.
5. Site design should incorporate sustainable landscape design practices, in accordance with the Sustainable Sites Initiative Rating System and Reference Guide.
6. The following exterior facade materials are prohibited on principal buildings:
   1. Reflective wall surface material with a Visible Light Reflectance (VLR) of greater than 15%.
