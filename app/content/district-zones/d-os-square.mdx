## 4.8.7 Specific Standards

1. The square must be organized around one or more central markers, such as a fountain or sculpture, to establish orientation and identity.
2. The square should be sized proportional to its anticipated public use; i.e. on a temperate, sunny day, it would be inhabited by no less than one person per 300 square feet of publicly accessible surface area.
3. Circulation within the square must follow the probable desire lines of its users, connecting pedestrians to rights-of-way on which the square abuts, entrances to buildings adjacent to the square, and major design features of the square, such as seating areas or open air cafes.
4. No surface area of the square that is intended for public use may be more than two feet above or below the adjacent sidewalk level.
5. Squares must be surfaced with durable, high- quality impervious or semi-pervious materials, such as concrete, brick, or stone pavers, for a minimum of 25% of the surface area.
6. To ensure comfort for the public, no surface area intended for public circulation may be sloped, unless required for stormwater management or to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.
7. One linear foot of seating must be provided for each linear foot of square perimeter. Six types of seating may be used to satisfy the seating requirements: moveable seating, fixed individual seats, fixed benches, seat walls, planter ledges, and seating steps. Deterrents to seating, such as spikes, rails, or deliberately uncomfortable materials or shapes, placed on surfaces that would be suitable for seating are prohibited.
8. Trees, if provided, must be formally arranged to frame spaces within the square.
9. Site design should incorporate sustainable landscape practices, in accordance with the Sustainable Sites Initiative Rating System and Reference Guide.
10. A square must not contain driveways, parking spaces, passenger drop-offs, garage entrances, loading berths, exhaust vents, mechanical equipment, or refuse or recycling storage.
11. The following exterior facade materials are prohibited on principal buildings:
    1. Reflective wall surface material with a Visible Light Reflectance (VLR) of greater than 15%.
