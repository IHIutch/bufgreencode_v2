In the case of a major subdivision application, the pre-application conference is mandatory.

   2. An application is not considered complete until all necessary forms, including forms relevant to the SEQRA process, are completed and all fees are paid, including fees for costs incurred by the City for notice.
5. Substantive Changes
   1. After an application is determined to be complete, any substantive change made by the applicant may require re-submittal of the entire application and a determination of completeness. If the appropriate ordinance administrator determines an application re- submittal, in whole or part, is necessary, the payment of additional fees is not required.
   2. Once the application is under consideration by the appropriate review body, additional information or revisions requested during review do not constitute a substantive change to the application.
6. Agency Reports. After an application is determined to be complete, it will be scheduled for consideration by the appropriate review body. The application may be forwarded to the Buffalo Sewer Authority, Buffalo Water Board, and Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets, if applicable, for a report. Reports from these agencies must be forwarded to the appropriate review body within 14 days of the determination of completeness.
7. Withdrawal. An application may be withdrawn at any time prior to the final decision on the application. The applicant is not eligible for a refund of fees. Requests for withdrawal must be made in writing by the applicant to the appropriate ordinance administrator.
8. Successive Applications
   1. A disapproved application may not be reconsidered for a minimum of one year from the date of denial, unless substantial new evidence is submitted by the applicant, or a significant mistake of law or of fact was made in the prior disapproval, that justifies reconsideration of the application. If the application is resubmitted earlier than one year from the date of disapproval, the subsequent application must include a detailed statement of the grounds justifying its consideration.
   2. If the appropriate ordinance administrator finds that there are no new grounds for consideration of the application, he/she will summarily, and without hearing, deny the request.
