## 8.3.1 General

1. Off-Street Parking. There are no provisions that establish a minimum number of off-street parking spaces for development. However, certain development proposals are required to complete a transportation demand management plan, per Section 8.4, which can result in the provision
   of off-street parking. Where provided, off-street vehicle parking must comply with the standards of this section.
2. Accessibility. All vehicle parking lots and parking structures must conform with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities published by the United States Access Board.
3. Parking Access

   1. All off-street vehicle parking must have direct access to a public right-of way through an alley, driveway, or permanent access easement.
   2. If an improved alley with a right-of-way of at least 18 feet in width is provided, all vehicle access should take place from the alley.
   3. Entries for parking must be placed along a secondary thoroughfare or alley, where practicable.

4. Vehicular Circulation

   1. All parking lots and parking structures must be designed so that vehicles enter or leave a parking space without having to move any other vehicle. Parking lots and structures where vehicles are moved by employees of the facility are exempt from this requirement.
   2. Parking lots and parking structures must be designed so that the driver of the vehicle proceeds forward into traffic rather than backs out into traffic.
   3. Parking lots and parking structures must be designed so that a vehicle is not forced to back onto the public right-of-way to gain access from one parking aisle to another parking aisle.
   4. Any parking row that does not provide two means of vehicular egress must provide, at the closed end, a space designated as a turn-around area. This space must be located at the end of a parking row, be designed with a minimum dimension of nine feet in width by nine feet in depth, and include a “No Parking” sign. Parking lots of less than 50 spaces are exempt from this provision.
   5. Vehicle circulation providing cross-access between abutting lots is encouraged.

5. Stall and Aisle Dimensions. All off-street parking spaces and drive aisles must comply with the minimum dimensional standards shown in Table 8B: Parking Stall and Drive Aisle Dimensions, with the following exceptions:
   1. Motorcycle and scooter parking stalls must measure at least four feet in width and eight feet in depth.
   2. Mechanical access parking is exempt from parking stall and drive aisle dimensional requirements.
6. Off-Site Parking. Accessory parking is allowed on an off-site lot within 1,320 feet of the use served, measured by closest walking distance from the closest public entrance to the off-site parking lot.
   1. Parking provided by valet service is not subject to the maximum distance requirement. No off-site parking lot may be located within an N-2R, N-3R, N-4-30, or N-4- 50 zone.
   2. An off-site parking lot is not permitted as a principal use in the N-1D, N-1C, N-2C, N-2E, N-3C, or N-3E zone, except in the case of a commercial or neighborhood parking lot open to the general public, as permitted under Article 6, Uses
7. Parking Surfaces. All driveways, parking stalls, drive aisles, and loading areas:
   1. Must be surfaced with fixed, firm, and non-slip material. Gravel may be used as a surface material only with the written consent of the Commissioner of Permit and Inspection Services. The portion of a driveway within a public right-of-way must be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets.
   2. Must be capable of withstanding the weight of vehicles and their loads.
   3. Should be rated with a Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) of at least 29.

## 8.3.2 Curb Cuts and Driveways

1. Curb Cuts
   1. A curb cut may be installed only with a curb cut permit per Section 11.4.2.
   2. Curb cuts must be located to minimize conflict with pedestrian, cyclist, and vehicular traffic on the abutting public right-of-way. Curb cuts should be located at least 60 feet from any intersection unless otherwise permitted by the Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, Parks, and Streets.
   3. The number and width of curb cuts must be the minimum needed to provide reasonable access to the site.
2. Driveway Dimensions. Driveways must be in accordance with Table 8C: Driveway Dimensions. A driveway flare may exceed the allowable driveway dimension by up to 18 inches on either side
3. Residential Driveways. For any property with a residential principal use in an N-2R, N-3R, N-4-30, or N-4-50 zone, there may only be one driveway, which must be a single-lane driveway, with the following exception:
   1. Multi-unit dwellings of more than six units may have one double-lane driveway or two single- lane driveways.
4. Shared Driveways. Shared driveways are permitted, so long as the width of the driveway meets the dimensional standards of Table 8C.
5. Double-Track Driveways. Double-track/wheel strip driveways are allowed, so long as each wheel strip is at least 18 inches in width and the area between the wheel strips is landscaped with living groundcover. However, within the public right-of-
   way, the driveway must be fully paved along its total width, from the property line to the curbline, per the specifications of the Commissioner of Public Works, Parks, and Streets.
6. Garage Aprons. A garage apron, that exceeds the maximum permitted driveway width, is permitted to extend for a depth of 25 feet from the garage
   doors, at which point the driveway must be no wider than the maximum permitted driveway width. The garage apron may be only as wide as the width of the garage.

## 8.3.3 Parking Lots

1. Accessory Parking Location. Accessory surface parking must be located on the site in relation to the principal building in accordance with Table 8D: Accessory Surface Parking Location, with the following exceptions:

   3. In the N-3E zone, a surface parking lot may be installed in an interior side yard only if expressly permitted by the City Planning Board during site plan review. In making such a determination, the City Planning Board must make written findings that the interior side parking lot will be consistent with the general character of the surrounding neighborhood and will not adversely impact the quality of the public realm. In no case may the City Planning Board grant such permission within the C-M overlay zone or where the construction of the parking lot requires the demolition of an existing building.
   4. Any variance sought related to this section will be considered an area variance, per Section 11.3.5.
2. Pedestrian Facilities

   1. All parking lots with three or more double- loaded rows must provide internal pedestrian walkways within the parking area and outside of the parking row.
      1. The walkway must be a minimum of eight feet in width. Walkways may be reduced to five feet in width if designed as a grade separated walkway with landscape buffers on either side.
